I did the extra points for the both question 1 and question 2. 

Use distExtraPoint for the Extra credit 1.

Use dist for the question 2.

I tried to use firebase for the question 2, but for some reasones it was not working very well.

For some reasons, when I test both of this dist files, the system will get confused. 

For example, after I test the distExtraPoint and I run http-server in dist file, the browser will bring me back to the distExtraPoint page. Pleases try both links "http://10.0.0.49:8080" and "http://127.0.0.1:8080" if the system has something wrong.
